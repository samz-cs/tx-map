<h1 id="texas-precinct-map--usage-guide">Texas Precinct Map Usage Guide</h1>
<p>This app visualizes Texas 2024 precinct results with interactive hovers, county rollups, and demographic filters. This was inspired by the NYT's <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/us/elections/2024-election-map-precinct-results.html">extremely detailed map of the 2024 election results</a>. I spent hours exploring it and thought it would be fun to make my own version with more interactive features and more detailed demographic data.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-see">What you see</h2>
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Outlines:<ul>
<li>Zoom > 8: black outline for hovered precinct only.</li>
